Primitive Data Types
    - number
    - bigint
    - boolean
    - undefined
    - object (null also shows up here)
    - string
    
Variables
    - var (apparently very dangerous) (global scope)
    - const (value can't be changed) (local scope)
    - let (local scope)
    
    var vs let: if you declare a let in a certain code block, then if you try to use the let outside of that code block, it will throw an error. 
    But with var, it can be used anywhere in the code. It declares variable 
    This can lead to memory leaks.
    
    
For Loops
Not really used in production anymore. This is covered just because we have to.

Compound Data Types
    - array (typeof results in object)
    - json
    
    to check if something is an array: 
        -check if it has length
        -Array.isArray(arr)
        
        
Map, Filter
